# Stock Price Prediction and Technical Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict stock prices using a combination of statistical models and technical analysis. The final deliverable will involve a detailed presentation showcasing the results of your predictions and insights.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Statistical Models for Stock Prediction
For each stock in the dataset, you will apply two statistical models to predict stock prices:

- **GARCH Model**:
  - Forecast stock return (daily log return) using the GARCH model.
- **Kalman Filter**:
  - Predict daily stock prices using the Kalman Filter.

#### Visualization:
- Compare the **predicted path** against the **actual stock return/price history** using appropriate plots.
  
#### Performance Metrics:
- Report the **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** to evaluate the accuracy of the models.

### 2. Technical Analysis for Understanding Trends
To enhance your understanding of the stock data, apply the following technical analysis indicators:

- **Trend Identification**:
  - Use **Simple Moving Averages (SMA)** and **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)** to identify price trends.
  
- **Overbought/Oversold Detection**:
  - Use the **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** to identify overbought or oversold conditions.
  
- **Buying/Selling Pressure**:
  - Analyze **On-Balance Volume (OBV)** to assess the pressure of buying or selling activity.
  
- **Candlestick Chart Patterns**:
  - Interpret market conditions using common candlestick patterns such as:
    - **Doji**
    - **Hammer**
    - **Hanging Man**
    - **Bullish/Bearish Engulfing**

### 3. Integration of Insights
Combine the insights from both statistical models (GARCH and Kalman Filter) and technical analysis to:

- Make informed interpretations of your **prediction results**.
- Explore basic **stock market analysis** based on the combined insights from statistical and technical indicators.

## Deliverables for the Presentation

1. **Model Forecast Visualization**:
   - Side-by-side visual comparison of the predicted vs actual stock prices and returns.

2. **Technical Analysis Insights**:
   - Graphs and insights based on SMA/EMA, RSI, OBV, and candlestick chart patterns.

3. **RMSE Reporting**:
   - Report the RMSE to demonstrate model performance.

4. **Interpretation and Analysis**:
   - Present a comprehensive analysis combining the results from statistical models and technical analysis.

## Conclusion
This project integrates both statistical forecasting methods and technical analysis indicators to provide a comprehensive view of stock price movements. The combination of predictive models and technical indicators will help in making informed interpretations and identifying significant trends in the market.
